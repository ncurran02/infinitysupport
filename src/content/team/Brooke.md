Hi, I'm Brooke, and I look after Rostering and Recruitment here at Infinity. I’m passionate about matching the right people with the right roles and making sure our team runs smoothly and efficiently. Outside of work, you’ll usually find me out in nature - camping, exploring new trails, or walking my dogs. I love the outdoors and the calm it brings, which helps keep me grounded and focused in a busy role.
