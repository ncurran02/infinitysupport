Clare has dedicated nearly 20 years to the disability sector, a field she feels deeply passionate about, with many of her family members also working in the industry. She began her career in Supported Independent Living (SIL), before transitioning to Day Placement after taking time to raise her child.

Throughout her career, Clare has consistently demonstrated a compassionate and committed approach to every task she undertakes. She has progressed from a Direct Support Worker to the role of 2IC, and later shifted her focus to Intake, where she has excelled in supporting participants to achieve their goals.

More recently, Clare transitioned into rostering and recruitment, where she ensures that participants continue to receive the support they need while also helping new support workers find meaningful roles within the field.
